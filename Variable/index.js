  // different types of variables


//   1. const varaible  : const variable are the constant variables that can't be changed after intialization
const id=56566
// id=154987   //TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

// 2. let variable: let variable are the variables that can be changed after intialization
// let name="John"

// we can also declare only variable without intialization
let name;

//3. var variable: var variable are the variables that can be changed after intialization

    /*the var keyword is used to declare variables that are function-scoped or globally-scoped,
     depending on where they are declared. Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top 
     of their containing function or script, which means they can be used before they are declared
     in the code,though they will be initialized to undefined */



//4. simple intialization to variable

// console.log(id);    
// console.log(name);
// console.log(email);
